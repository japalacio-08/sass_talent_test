# Task 3: Production Issues

[< Back to solutions menu](../readme.md)

 If we are having a production issue, how would you go about troubleshooting it? Letâ€™s assume we are a new company, and you are the lead over this project, and nothing is set up correctly. What steps would you take to make sure we can troubleshoot any production issues going forward?

## Solution

1. Triage: Identify the issue and its impact (Check logs and monitoring is a good start).

2. Mitigation and containment: Take action to mitigate the impact of the issue and contain the issue to prevent it from getting worse (Rollback and keep +product team informed).

3. RCA: Identify the root cause of the issue (Check logs, monitoring, and code).

4. Monitoring: Set up monitoring and alerts to prevent the issue from happening again (Alerting, Logging, Error Tracking, Performance Metrics, Backups and recovery...).

5. Preventive measures: Identify and implement preventive measures to prevent the issue from happening again (Code review, Testing, CI/CD, Security, Documentation, and others).

6. Postmortem: Document the issue and the steps taken to resolve it (Document the issue, the root cause, the mitigation, and the monitoring).

7. Follow-up: Follow up with the team to ensure the issue is resolved and the monitoring is in place (Follow up with the team and the monitoring).

8. Training & Documentation: Ensure all the team members are familiarized with the environment, good practices, workflows, etc... (A good onboarding is also a good point in this situation)
